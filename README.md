## Intro

Tronscan API provides data for the Tronscan Frontend. Tronscan API is built with Scala using Play Framework and Akka Streams.

The non-blocking architecture of Play combined with the reactive streams of Akka provides a high performance synchronisation system.

## Features

* Import of the blockchain from Full/Solidity Node
* Swagger UI for API documentation
* EHCache / Redis Caching
* Socket.io API provides a stream of events from the blockchain
* Network Scanner scans the network using GRPC and hops between nodes to find all the nodes in the network
* GRPC Load Balancer uses data provided from the network scanner to find the fastest nodes to communicate with
* Vote Scraper makes periodic snapshots of the votes to provide historical vote data
* (Beta) Remote Device signing provides a websocket API to sign transactions from an external device

# Requirements

* PostgreSQL 9.6
* Java 8
* Redis
* [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html)

# Installation

* Create a new database in PostgreSQL, for example `tron-explorer`
* Create the schema by running the [schema script](schema/schema.sql)
* Change the `slick.dbs.default` and `db.default` connection details in [application.conf](conf/application.conf)

# Running

* Run `sbt run`

# GRPC API

The GRPC api is intended to be a JSON proxy for the GRPC api

## Creating Transactions

Transactions can be created, signed and broadcasted to the network. 
This feature should only be used for test purposes or on a self-hosted instance.
Never send your private keys to api.tronscan.org

### API

All contract endpoints support:

__Broadcast__

Broadcast the transaction to the network.

The private key is required when broadcasting a transaction

```json
"broadcast": true
```

__Signing__

Sign the transaction with a private key.

only use this for testing or self-hosted instances.

```
"key": "FFA5EA61073FB13E1559F182F91E25C3E51C03906428C7BC8C865A335AED7617"
```

__Example__

Broadcast a signed transfer contract to the network

```
{
  "contract": {
    "ownerAddress": "TPwJS5eC5BPGyMGtYTHNhPTB89sUWjDSSu",
    "toAddress": "TWxKPGEyGWEP87Z4GrBccQiWQCf5iUHx9E",
    "amount": 100000
  },

  "broadcast": true
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "code": "SUCCESS",
    "message": ""
  } 
}
```
